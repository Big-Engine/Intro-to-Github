Version control is a way of setting control to changes made to any form of an important document.
It involves the use of tools to track these changes, made by anyone or any system. It also helps to 
set controls to the level access a third party has to such documents or when necessary changes are made to such documents by an external person.
Git is a software development version control tool used for versioning, tracking and making changes, updating changes to any software development project.
